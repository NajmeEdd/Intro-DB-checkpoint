Relational databases can be used for everything from simple tasks like storing artist, album, and song information for a music retailer, to more complex activities like a financial institution’s records of stock and bond trades and other transactions for its customer base.

Relational databases are a good tool for managing a large amount of information because of their built-in scalability and flexibility. They also allow you to easily add new categories to the schema, don’t require you to update the software, and won’t impact existing data.
SQL (pronounced “sequel”) is the most commonly used RDBMS. It’s based on SEQUEL (Structured English QUEry Language), a language created at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce, based on Edgar F. Codd’s relational model (more information below). In 1979, Relational Software, Inc. (later known as Oracle) released the first commercial SQL version. SQL has been in use for so long because it’s easy to learn, ubiquitous, and stable, and it performs well.
